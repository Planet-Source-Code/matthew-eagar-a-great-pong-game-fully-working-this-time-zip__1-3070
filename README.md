## A great pong game, fully working this time, Zip\!


</div>

### Description

This is a fully working pong game, almost identical to the origional one. It has a fairly good (but very basic) computer player, and the ball deflects at different angles depending on how far away from the center of the paddle it is.

Ok, I just re-wrote this in VB3 so that every body can have access to it, and I'm putting it up in a zip file again. The VB6 version is included in the zip.
 
### More Info

'Just download the ZIP file. If your running VB3 / VB4 then run pongVB3.mak

'if your running VB 6 then run pongVB6.vbp
